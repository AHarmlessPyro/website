              <h1>Boost Library Official Maintainer Program</h1>

              <h2>Introduction</h2>

              <p>There are a large number of libraries, still in use and not
              actively maintained, which have been identified by the <a href=
              "https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/CommunityMaintenance">Boost
              Community Maintenance Team</a>. The CMT, however, lacks the
              resources to properly maintain all of them. To protect the
              reputation that boost has cultivated over the years, as a
              organization that provides high quality open source software,
              it is critical that all libraries bundled with boost releases
              have active and engaged maintainers. The purpose of this
              program is to recruit companies and organizations, that are
              likely providing internal support, to officially take over
              maintenance of one or more libraries they depend on.</p>

              <p>In exchange for maintenance, organizations will be
              officially recognized by Boost and allowed to display their
              logo on the Boost Library Official Maintainer site for their
              library.</p>

              <h2>Memorandum of Understanding</h2>

              <p>This Memorandum of Understanding is intended to outline
              what's expected of library maintainers. By adopting a library,
              maintainers are explicitly agreeing to provide sufficient
              resources to acheive the following:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Resolve tickets in a timely manner.</li>

                <li>Support users via email and IRC.</li>

                <li>Merge pulls requests when appropriate.</li>

                <li>Support the release team during release preparation.</li>

                <li>Ensure tests pass on all supported platforms.</li>

                <li>Maintain documentation.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Exiting the Program</h2>

              <p>In the chance that maintainers can no longer provide
              adequate resources required to maintain their library, we ask
              that they provide a 30-day notice, so that other maintainers
              can be found. If the Boost committee feels maintainers are not
              adequately supporting a library, they reserve the right to
              rescind this agreement with a 30-day notice.</p>
